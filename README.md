## What is it?
Google's library for managing [APK expansion files](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html).

**Note:** This is *not* a direct copy of Google's library. It includes additional bug fixes and improvements. These include a workaround to an [Android 6 permissions bug](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=197287), which requires users to download two copies of your expansion file. As such, it may not be suitable for projects with very large expansion files.

## Why here?
Because of Google hasn't published it to any repository yet.

## Where published?
[Here](https://bintray.com/shotzoom/apk-expansion)

## How to use?
Modify `build.gradle`:
```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/shotzoom/apk-expansion' }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.shotzoom.coachnow.expansion:expansion:VERSION@aar'
    compile 'com.shotzoom.coachnow.expansion:license:VERSION@aar'
    compile 'com.shotzoom.coachnow.expansion:zip:VERSION@aar'
}
```
See the latest versions [here](https://bintray.com/alexeydanilov/apk-expansion).

## How to modify
After making code changes run the following command to push new changes to bintray
```
./gradlew clean build bintrayUpload -PbintrayUser=shotzoom -PbintrayKey=e73ea907095b2b30459c1668c4f993f2a29b1640 -PdryRun=true
```

## Thanks
Thanks for [bintray-release](https://github.com/novoda/bintray-release) for easy publishing.
